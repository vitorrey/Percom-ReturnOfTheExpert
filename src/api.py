"""
HARBench Public API

Lightweight entry point for using HARBench feature-extraction models on
your own IMU data, without going through the full training pipeline.

Example
-------
    import harbench

    model = harbench.load_model("mtl")
    feats = model.encode(x)        # x: (N, 3, 150)  ->  feats: (N, 512)

Input format
------------
`encode` expects windowed, channel-first IMU data shaped as:

    (num_windows, num_sensors * 3, sequence_length)

where each sensor contributes 3 channels (x, y, z), in the same order the
model was trained with. The pretrained `mtl` weights were trained on
30 Hz, 5-second windows (sequence_length = 150), so that is the
recommended window size, though the backbone accepts other lengths.
